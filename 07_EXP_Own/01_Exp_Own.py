Total Recruitment Count:
10 + 20 + 30 = 60

Department 1:
(10 / 60) * 100 = 16.67%

Department 2:
(20 / 60) * 100 = 33.33%

Department 3:

1. What is Usage Matrix in relation to Power BI?
A Usage Matrix in Power BI refers to a report that tracks and displays the usage statistics of reports, dashboards, and datasets within the Power BI workspace. It shows important details like:

Who is accessing the reports.
Frequency of usage.
Interactions with visualizations.
User-level engagement metrics.
This type of report helps administrators and report owners understand how their Power BI content is being utilized across the organization, helping them optimize reports, troubleshoot issues, and track user activity.




2. How to Get Usage Matrix for All Reports in a Workspace in a Single Usage Matrix Report?


Summary:

By combining the Power BI Activity API or Usage Metrics and creating a Matrix Visual in Power BI, you can aggregate usage data for all reports in a workspace into a single consolidated Usage Matrix report. This helps you efficiently monitor report usage across your organization.



To create a Usage Matrix report that aggregates usage data for all reports in a specific workspace, follow these steps:

Step 1: Enable Audit Logs (Power BI Admin)
Step 2: Use Power BI Activity API
Step 3: Use Power BI Service Usage Metrics




Step 1: Enable Audit Logs (Power BI Admin)
You must have Power BI Admin or Global Admin permissions to access audit logs. These logs contain user activity data.

Go to the Power BI Admin Portal.
Under Audit Logs, enable logging to track usage of reports, dashboards, and datasets.


Step 2: Use Power BI Activity API

Power BI provides an Activity API to retrieve detailed usage data across reports and workspaces. This can be used to track who is accessing reports, their interactions, and other relevant activities.

Steps:

Query the Power BI REST API to retrieve activity data across workspaces.
Youâ€™ll need an Azure Active Directory (AAD) application with the necessary permissions to access this API.
Use the Get Activity Reports function to retrieve report usage metrics.


Step 3: Use Power BI Service Usage Metrics

You can use Power BI Service Usage Metrics to track usage for individual reports, dashboards, and workspaces:

In Power BI Service, go to the workspace containing the reports.
Click on the Usage Metrics tab for individual reports (under Settings for each report).
For a consolidated usage report, export the usage data for each report and merge them into one dataset in Power BI.
Step 4: Create a Usage Matrix Report
Once you have the usage data, you can create a Usage Matrix report:

Load the usage data into Power BI (either by pulling from the API or importing exported files).
Design the report:
Use Matrix Visuals to display user activity metrics like views, interactions, and frequency.
Organize the data by user (rows) and report or workspace (columns).
You can enhance this report by adding filters for dates, users, or reports to allow deeper analysis.

- what are the exact options available when you go to update the bookmarks.

Summary:
When updating a bookmark, you can control the following:

Data (filter selections and slicer states),
Display (visibility of visuals),
Current Page (page where the bookmark was created),
Selected Visuals (specific visuals' states).
These options allow you to have a high level of control over how the bookmark behaves when activated.



How to Update a Bookmark:
Go to the View tab in Power BI Desktop.
In the Bookmarks pane, right-click on an existing bookmark.
Select Update from the context menu.
The Update Bookmark dialog will appear, allowing you to choose which of the above options to include in the update.


- different transformations used in your report.

- combine two string columns.

- how do you clean the data.

- how are you sharing your reports.

- I don't want to use schedule refresh, still how to refresh the report, remove manual as well.

If you want to avoid scheduled and manual refresh:

Use DirectQuery or Live Connection to query the data in real time.
Consider using Push Data through the Power BI API or Azure Stream Analytics for real-time updates.
